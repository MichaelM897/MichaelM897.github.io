    <h3> Helping Others </h3>
    <p>I been told I am a very good friend by people who open up to me. I think that people should be be comfortable to open up to good friends, but people can just be plain rude. I just listen to what people have to say and try to understand. I can’t understand what people have been through, unless I experience what they went through or I have a similar way of their thinking. Everyone takes things differently, so I try to understand why that person thinks that way to further try to find a way to help them. I am a very understanding person and helping people is my specialty. I just I am good at what I do.

    <h3> Basketball </h3>
   <p>Basketball is a sport that takes the best out of me. I want to make it to the NBA, but of course that is the dream of every kid, but I know I will make there one day. With school, family, and friends it is harder to make time for myself and basketball. I want to work full time into playing basketball, so I can get better. However, my mom is having another baby and I am a honor/advance student, I have a sister, I take care of my family, and with all of things I do daily I don’t have so much time for myself. I always put family first and there is not much time for me, but I have to do what is right.

    <h3> School </h3>
    <p>School is a scary word for most teenagers. School is like a living in hell with fire in everyone eyes, getting yelled at for not understanding something simple, and it just all so hard. For me personally school is like an ocean. In different bodies of water the waves are calm, while some are rough. School is mainly rough because of all the homework I got. School is also a fun place to be in because all my friends are here and it always fun to spend time to relax and have fun. However, with homework and studying in the way it is hard to make time for myself. I just have to organize myself and find a way.
